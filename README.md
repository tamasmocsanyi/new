# Football API Project - Odds for Premier League Fixtures on Dec 30

This project involves making API requests to the [Football API](https://www.api-football.com/) to gather football-related data, specifically from the "odds" endpoint for the Premier League fixtures on December 30.

## Getting Started

1. **API Key:**
   Get your API key from [Football API](https://www.api-sports.io/) to access the data.

2. **Project Details:**
   - The primary goal is to retrieve information of odds for the Premier League fixtures that were played on December 30 using the 'https://v3.football.api-sports.io/odds' endpoint."

   - The script makes an API request to the "odds" endpoint and saves the received JSON response to a file for future reference and data manipulation.

   - After obtaining the JSON data, the script parses it, and additional processing is performed, including deleting unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset and renaming columns for clarity.

   -Visualizations are created to facilitate both comprehension and analysis of the data.
